## Introduction

Hello! Welcome to the code repository for our paper.

If you've seen the paper, or looked at our GEO/EGA accessions, you'll realise there's a *lot* of data/analysis - please ask us if you have any issues with, want to discuss, or need help troubleshooting the code.

* WGBS, RNAseq data processing; methylation analysis (PMD/LMR/DMV feature calling, basic statistics, etc. as in Figs 1-2) was handled by Zuguang Gu [email: z.gu [AT] dkfz-heidelberg.de]
* ChIPseq data processing; tumour/cell line ChromHMM, tumour CRC analysis (as in Fig 3) was done by Carl Hermann [email: carl.herrmann [AT] bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de ] and Qi Wang
* Mouse RNAseq data processing; RTN Master Regulator (SFig 3), RNAseq subtype genes (SFig 2), tumour methylation microarrays (Fig 7, SFig 1), cell line gene expression microarrays analyses (SFig 5), cell line ATAC/ChIPseq analysis (Fig 4, SFig 6) and the re-analysis of the Darmanis (2017) scRNAseq data (as in Fig 4) were performed by Mike Fletcher [email: m.fletcher [AT] dkfz-heidelberg.de OR sci [AT] dismissed.net.nz]

For general enquiries, please contact the corresponding authors: Carl (email above) or Bernhard Radlwimmer [email: b.radlwimmer [AT] dkfz-heidelberg.de]
